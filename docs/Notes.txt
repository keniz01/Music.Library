Configurations steps
----------------------

1) Run the music_database_generator.sql script in SQL Management Studio or however.
2) When published to IIS you may encounter - "Login failed for user IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool" error
In SQL Management Studio, add IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool via the SQL Server Logins folder.
Go to MusicContext and map IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool to MusicContext then assign dbOwner membership (to execute sprocs)
3).editorconfig is a configurable file that overwrites any user settings in VS2019. This is used to enforce my personal coding style! Its a bit strict, for consistence
